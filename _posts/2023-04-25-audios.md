Audio recordings capture something that photos and documents cannotâ€”the actual voices, laughter, and stories of our family members. This guide explains how to contribute audio content to our family archive.

## Types of Family Audio

### Oral Histories
- Life story interviews with family elders
- Personal accounts of family events
- Stories about family traditions and heritage
- Memories of ancestors and family origins

### Everyday Moments
- Phone conversations with distant relatives
- Children's voices at different ages
- Family singing or playing music together
- Holiday greetings and messages

## Recording Guidelines

When creating audio recordings for the family archive:

### Technical Tips
- **Use a quiet environment** to minimize background noise
- **Speak clearly** and at a normal pace
- **Test your recording device** beforehand
- **Save in common formats** (MP3, WAV, M4A)

### Content Suggestions
- **Include introductions**: "This is [Name] speaking on [Date]"
- **Provide context**: Explain when and where events occurred
- **Ask follow-up questions**: Encourage detailed storytelling
- **Record multiple sessions**: Don't try to capture everything at once

### Important Topics to Capture
- Family history and genealogy
- Immigration stories and cultural heritage
- Career achievements and life lessons
- Funny family stories and inside jokes
- Holiday traditions and family customs

## Preserving Historical Audio

If you have old cassette tapes, vinyl records, or other historical audio formats, we can help digitize them for the archive. These might include:

- Answering machine messages from loved ones
- Wedding speeches and toasts
- Children's school performances
- Family musical recordings
- Historical family radio shows or interviews
