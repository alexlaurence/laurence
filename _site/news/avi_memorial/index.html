  <article class="post-content">
    
    <div id="markdown-content">
      <p>It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Avishkar “Avi” Chetri, aged 29, who died by suicide in November 13 2023. Avi was not just a cherished member of our family, but a brilliant artist whose work touched many lives and whose vision for a more compassionate world will continue to inspire us.</p>

<h2 id="a-gifted-artist-and-philosopher">A Gifted Artist and Philosopher</h2>

<p>Avi graduated with an MA in Animation from the Royal College of Art in 2018, where his extraordinary talent for hand-drawn animation became a powerful medium for exploring complex themes of displacement, belonging, and identity. Living with autism spectrum disorder, Avi harnessed his unique perspective to create animated films that resonated with universal appeal, delving into the intricate personal struggles of individuals while making a compelling call for a shift in collective consciousness.</p>

<p>His animated works served as a touching tribute to his artistic vision and profound philosophical insights. These films were not merely artistic expressions but unique windows into Avi’s inner world, intertwining his personal narrative with broader societal issues, all deeply influenced by his dedication to Buddhist principles. The subtle nuances of his hand-drawn art belied a depth that forged meaningful connections with audiences, inviting them to share in his characters’ journeys.</p>

<h2 id="a-vision-for-change">A Vision for Change</h2>

<p>Avi’s creative output challenged the norm of self-centeredness, advocating for a shift towards empathy, interconnectedness, and mindfulness. His animations encouraged a reevaluation of our life choices and our interactions with others, promoting a vision of the world characterized by solidarity, compassion, and collective awakening. His belief in the power of community to mitigate isolation and individualism shone through as a hopeful theme for a more harmonious future.</p>

<h2 id="digital-legacy-and-posthumous-archiving">Digital Legacy and Posthumous Archiving</h2>

<p>Beyond his artistic work, Avi had a profound intellectual interest in posthumous digital archiving and what happens to our digital presence after death. In his thoughtful essay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210614032337/http://avichetri.co.uk/death-and-the-digital-afterlife/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Death and the Digital Afterlife”</a>, he explored how our online presence transforms from a representation of ourselves into a “simulating copy” after death.</p>

<p>Avi wrote about the philosophical concept of preservation—how friends and families use digital traces to preserve the memories, individuality, and personality of deceased loved ones. He understood that while our social media accounts cannot copy our consciousness, they become important vessels for those who survive us to maintain connection and memory. His exploration of this topic reveals yet another layer of his deep thinking about human connection, mortality, and the ways we continue to exist in the memories and digital spaces of others.</p>

<p>This prescient interest in digital preservation takes on profound meaning in light of his own digital legacy, as his work continues to inspire and connect with people through the very digital channels he thoughtfully examined.</p>

<h2 id="our-loss-our-love">Our Loss, Our Love</h2>

<p>As a family, we will forever remember Avi’s gentle spirit, his philosophical insights, and his unwavering commitment to creating art that could make the world a better place. His loss is immeasurable, but his legacy lives on through his work and the values he championed—mindfulness, peace, and love as active agents in shaping a compassionate and interconnected world.</p>

<h2 id="mental-health-awareness">Mental Health Awareness</h2>

<p>Avi’s passing serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of mental health awareness, particularly among young people and those with autism spectrum disorder. We hope that by sharing his story, we can contribute to greater understanding and support for those who may be struggling with similar challenges.</p>

<p>The Royal College of Art held a memorial screening in 16 February 2024 to celebrate Avi’s life and work, bringing together staff, friends, and family to share memories and highlight the critical importance of mental health support in our communities.</p>

<p>In a touching display of family unity across continents, a parallel memorial screening was held in Kathmandu, Nepal, lovingly organized by Avi’s cousin, Rhea Pradhan.</p>

<p>In honour of Avi’s digital afterlife, you can find a comprehensive collection of Avi’s films and works in the Laurence family archives. His animations are available in the <a href="/en/video-archive/">video archive</a> and his artwork can be found in the <a href="/en/image-archive/">image archive</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>In remembrance of Avi, who through his eyes, invited us all to embark on a path of transformative change, recognizing the critical role our actions and mindset play in creating the future he dreamed of.</em></p>

<p>Through Avi’s vision, we are inspired to further his dream of a world where mindfulness, peace, and love are not just ideals, but active forces shaping our daily lives and communities.</p>

<p>He will be deeply missed and lovingly remembered by all of us in the Laurence family.</p>
